# Stack

Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out) where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container. A real life analogy could be a pile of CDs. To access the bottom CD, without picking up the entire pile, the only way to access the bottom CD would be to removed the CDs on top of it one by one, (essentially popping the CDs from the pile). Stacks are implmented as container adaptors, which are classes that use an encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a 


## Advantages:

- A stack helps to manage the data in the "Last in First out" method
- When the variable is not used outside the function in any program, the Stack can be used
- It allows you to control and handle memory allocation and deallocation
- It helps to automatically clean up the objects

## Disadvantages:

- It is difficult in Stack to create many objects as it increases the risk of the Stack overflow
- It has very limited memory
- In Stack, random access is not possible
